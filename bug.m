In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to object ownership and the `retain`/`release` cycle (or its modern counterpart, Automatic Reference Counting or ARC).  Consider the following scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *someString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.someString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

If `someMethod` is called multiple times, and the previous `someString` is never explicitly released or nilled, this creates a memory leak. Each call to `someMethod` allocates a new string, but the previous string remains in memory because the `strong` property keeps a reference to it.  Even with ARC, failing to properly manage object lifecycles, particularly within loops or asynchronous operations, can lead to unexpected behavior and retain cycles.

Another issue is improper use of delegates. If a delegate is not properly set to `nil` when it's no longer needed or if the delegate object is deallocated before the delegating object releases its strong reference, a crash can occur.
